   Both temperature and humidity values are scaled by 10 multiplier. GPIO and
   clock handlers are required to perform the probe.

       the high state is recommended (to limit the shorted circuit current)
       rather than required since the dht_probe() will initially reset the sensor
       by long shorting the data wire to the ground.
   GPIO post-call state:
       Data pin: set high as an open-drain emulated output.
